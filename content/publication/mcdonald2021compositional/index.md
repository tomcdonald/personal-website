abstract: Effectively modeling phenomena present in highly nonlinear dynamical systems
whilst also accurately quantifying uncertainty is a challenging task, which often re-
quires problem-specific techniques. We present a novel, domain-agnostic approach
to tackling this problem, using compositions of physics-informed random features,
derived from ordinary differential equations. The architecture of our model lever-
ages recent advances in approximate inference for deep Gaussian processes, such
as layer-wise weight-space approximations which allow us to incorporate random
Fourier features, and stochastic variational inference for approximate Bayesian
inference. We provide evidence that our model is capable of capturing highly
nonlinear behaviour in real-world multivariate time series data. In addition, we
find that our approach achieves comparable performance to a number of other
probabilistic models on benchmark regression tasks.
