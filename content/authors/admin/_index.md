I am currently a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at The University of Sheffield, working on physics-informed probabilistic deep learning under the supervision of Dr Mauricio Álvarez. Previously, I completed my masters and undergraduate degrees in the Computer Science and Physics departments at Sheffield respectively, and have also worked as an analyst in the energy sector.
