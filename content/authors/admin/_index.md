I am currently a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at The University of Manchester, working on physics-informed probabilistic deep learning under the supervision of Dr Mauricio √Ålvarez. Previously, I obtained my masters and undergraduate degrees in the Computer Science and Physics departments respectively at The University of Sheffield, and I have also worked as an analyst in the energy sector and as a summer research intern at Spotify.
