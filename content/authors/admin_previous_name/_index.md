I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Technologist at Ofcom, working within the Online Safety Group on research relating to recommender systems, and more broadly, responsible AI. I obtained my PhD from The University of Manchester in 2024, where I worked within the Centre for AI Fundamentals on physics-informed probabilistic deep learning under the supervision of Dr Mauricio √Ålvarez. During my PhD, in 2022, I worked as a research intern at Spotify on bandit algorithms for podcast recommendation. Prior to my PhD and MSc, I also have experience working as an analyst in the energy sector.
